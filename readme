final_code
This folder contains code for processing and analyzing EEG data.
Folder Structure
final_code/
process_eeg.py: For preprocessing EEG data
eeg_transformer.py: For training a Transformer model
cnn.py: For training a CNN model for comparison
How to Use
Data Preprocessing
Open process_eeg.py and change the path for reading .set files.
Run process_eeg.py. This will process all .set files and save them as all_data.npz.
Training the Transformer Model
Run eeg_transformer.py. This will use all_data.npz for training and save the best model.
Training the CNN Model
Run cnn.py. This will use all_data.npz for training, for comparison.
Note
Make sure to run process_eeg.py before running eeg_transformer.py or cnn.py.
